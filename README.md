A big brain AI for a big brain game!  
If you don't know how this game works, just look it up. I frankly don't really know how it works, either.
## `core` module
This module contains all the inner workings for the game.
## `console` module
This module is useful for base-level testing for the game via the command line or just having a little fun by yourself if you're lonely. (It's called practicing, right?)
## `server` module
**Coming soon**  
This module is used to set up a central server to handle requests and communication between people.
## `client` module
**Coming soon**  
This module is going to connect to the central server with a command-line interface to play with others via a central server.
## `ai` module
**Coming soon**
This module is going to connect to the central server to whup sum human bum. And, no, there's _no_ machine learning in here. I'm too dumb to know how to do that, let alone in Java.
